# Gmod-E2
My various E2 scripts.

# Description
* **AFK_Mass** - Surpasses anti-AFK system in a non-trivial way. Spawn a hover vehicle, place a E2 on it, and sit inside. The vehicle w ill move slightly while you take a break
* **Crazy_Whiskey** - Completely thrashes server's chat, weapon switch, console and some other threads. Spawn a console screen or a ZSPU, place a E2 on it, and enjoy the results. Best of all, nobody can track down why the things happen! Crazy whiskey it is.
* **Drunkenzerg** - Slowly overflows the server's dynamic memory causing it to crash in minutes. Usage
	* Place E2
	* Wait until it crashes
	* Edit script slighly to use half the space blocks
	* Place another E2 again
	* DO NOT delete anything, and wait another 10-20 seconds
	* Muhahaha
* **E2_Proxy** - A script from an unfinished project to passing HTTP data over the server's IP address. Frontend needs to be yet written
* **Fake_Moneyprinter** - A simplistic fake moneyprinter for Darkrp
* **hoyo_Midi_Player_V6** - Plays MIDI music on the server as it can. Requires. midi.php and mc.php
* **Image_Writer** - Prints a real-world image on the digital screen. Requires image.php
* **Mario_Underwater_Theme** - A port from ZSPU. Play Super Mario Bros Underwater theme
* **QMON** - takes a String (non-delimited, ie "9A"), and a user wirelink, and then traverses the user and turns it on and off, pressing the listed entities. Useful for RP (money stealing), Sandbox (pressing random others buttons) or elsewhere  (opening and closing doors)
